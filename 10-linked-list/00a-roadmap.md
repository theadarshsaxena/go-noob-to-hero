## Mastery Path for Linked Lists in Go for DSA & Competitive Programming

Here’s a comprehensive roadmap of topics and subtopics you should cover, organized from basics to advanced, to master linked lists for DSA and competitive programming in Go:

### 1. **Introduction to Linked Lists**
- What is a linked list? Types of linked lists
- Node structure and implementation in Go
- Pointer basics in Go and working with references

### 2. **Singly Linked List**
- Creating a singly linked list
- Traversal (iterative and recursive)
- Insertion (at head, tail, given position)
- Deletion (at head, tail, given position)
- Searching (iterative and recursive)
- Reversing a singly linked list (iterative and recursive)

### 3. **Doubly Linked List**
- Structure and node implementation in Go
- Insertion (head, tail, position)
- Deletion (head, tail, position)
- Bidirectional traversal
- Reversing a doubly linked list

### 4. **Circular Linked List**
- Implementation of circular singly and doubly linked lists
- Node insertion and deletion
- Traversal logic (working with looping lists)

### 5. **Key Patterns and Problems**
- Finding the middle of a linked list (fast & slow pointer)
- Detecting cycles (Floyd’s algorithm)
- Removing a loop in linked list
- Finding the nth node from the end (two-pointer technique)
- Merging two sorted linked lists
- Intersection of two linked lists
- Checking if the list is a palindrome
- Partitioning a linked list around a value

### 6. **Advanced Operations**
- Copying a linked list with random pointers
- Flattening a multilevel linked list
- Reversing nodes in k-groups
- Group-wise reversal (e.g., reverse alternate k nodes)
- Sorting a linked list (merge sort, insertion sort)
- LRU cache (using doubly linked list + hashmap)
- Implementing stacks and queues using linked lists

### 7. **Linked List in Competitive Programming**
- Handling large input efficiently
- Edge case handling (empty lists, single node, loops)
- Time and space complexity analysis for linked list operations
- Dynamic memory management and garbage collection in Go
- Debugging pointers and nil references in Go

### 8. **Practice and Problem Solving**
- Implement standard operations from scratch (without libraries)
- Solve classic linked list problems from competitive programming sites (LeetCode, Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.)
- Participate in timed contests focusing on data structures

### Learning Notes:

- Focus on coding each operation by hand in Go to internalize pointer handling and memory management.
- Study common patterns (fast/slow pointers, dummy heads, boundary checks).
- Practice with edge cases (empty list, single node, cycles).
- After each topic, solve hand-picked problems to reinforce learning and improve speed.

Mastering these topics will equip you to handle virtually all linked list problems encountered in competitive programming and interviews.
