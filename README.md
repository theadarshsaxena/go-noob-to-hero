# Go DSA: From Basics to Advanced

Welcome to my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Go! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress, solutions, and explanations as I explore DSA concepts from the ground up using Go this time!

## Structure

- The repository is organized into folders, each representing a different DSA topic.
- Each folder contains questions, solutions, and detailed explanations.

## 🧩 Filename Format

```bash
<number>-<difficulty><importance>-<name>.go

- 📌 Based on **filename pattern**, it adds icons for:
  - Difficulty: `e`, `m`, `h` → (Easy, Medium, Hard) -> 💡, 🔥, 💀
  - Importance: `n`, `i`, `v` → (Not Important, Important, Very Important) -> 😴, ☑️, ✅

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, new questions, or alternative solutions, feel free to open a pull request.

Happy coding!
