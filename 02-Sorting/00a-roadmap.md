This roadmap is structured to take you from foundational sorting concepts to advanced algorithms, Go language specifics, real-world applications, and optimization strategies. Each topic includes relevant subtopics to ensure a comprehensive understanding.

### 1. **Introduction to Sorting**

- Why Sorting Matters in DSA
- Stable vs. Unstable Sorting Algorithms
- In-place Sorting vs. Out-of-place Sorting
- Time and Space Complexity Overview (O(n log n), O(n²), etc.)
- Use Cases in Real-world Scenarios

### 2. **Golang Basics for Sorting**

- Slices and Arrays: Declaration, Initialization, and Manipulation
- Working with Custom Types and Structs
- Basics of Go’s `sort` Package (overview)

### 3. **Elementary Sorting Algorithms**

#### - Bubble Sort
  - Concept and Implementation
  - Best/Worst/Average Case Analysis

#### - Selection Sort
  - Logic and Implementation
  - Pros and Cons

#### - Insertion Sort
  - Step-wise Understanding
  - Use Cases (Nearly sorted data)

#### - Practice: Coding and Testing all the above in Go

### 4. **Divide and Conquer Sorting Algorithms**

#### - Merge Sort
  - Recursive and Iterative Approaches
  - Merge Logic in Go Slices
  - Stability and Efficiency

#### - Quick Sort
  - Pivot Selection Strategies
  - Partitioning Logic
  - Recursive vs. Iterative Implementations

### 5. **Non-comparison Sorting Algorithms**

#### - Counting Sort
  - Suitable Data Types and Use Cases
  - Time/Space Considerations

#### - Radix Sort
  - Digit by Digit Sorting
  - Handling Strings/Numeric Values

#### - Bucket Sort
  - Bucket Design and Optimization

### 6. **Advanced and Hybrid Sorting Techniques**

#### - Heap Sort
  - Max-Heap & Min-Heap Building in Go
  - Time and Space Complexity

#### - Shell Sort
  - Gap Sequences
  - Optimization Strategies

#### - TimSort (Hybrid)
  - Used in Go's built-in sort (since Go 1.8+ for large slices)
  - Advantages & Internals

### 7. **Go's Built-in `sort` Package**

- Functions: `sort.Ints`, `sort.Strings`, `sort.Float64s`
- Sorting Custom Types with `sort.Interface`
  - Implementing `Len()`, `Less()`, and `Swap()`
- Sorting with `sort.Slice`, `sort.SliceStable`
- Comparison with `sort.Sort` and `sort.Stable`
- Tips for Efficient Sorting in Go

### 8. **Practical Aspects**

- Sorting Custom Structs/Slices (by multiple fields, etc.)
- Sorting Large Data Sets (memory management, streaming)
- Sorting with Goroutines (Concurrency Considerations)
- Sorting Data from/for External Sources (files, APIs)

### 9. **Complexity and Optimization**

- Analyzing Real-World Performance (profiling with Go tools)
- Avoiding Common Pitfalls (memory leaks, copy vs. reference, etc.)
- Benchmarking Sorting Functions in Go

### 10. **Interview-level Problems & Applications**

- Top-K/Partial Sorting
- External/Chunked/Multi-threaded Sorting
- “Sort Colors”, “Sort Linked List”, “Wiggle Sort”, etc.
- Trick Questions (e.g., sorting in O(1) space, sorting with constraints)

### 11. **Competitive Programming and Beyond**

- What kinds of custom sorters are often useful?
- When NOT to use sorting (and alternatives)
- Integration with search algorithms (binary search, etc.)

***Tip:*** Practice each algorithm by implementing from scratch in Golang, then with Go’s `sort` utilities. Try coding real coding interview questions and time your solutions for performance insights.

This roadmap ensures you gain both deep theoretical knowledge and practical, idiomatic Go skills for every aspect of sorting in DSA.
